## ✨ Overview

PolyAny provides a flexible framework for representing and manipulating multivariate polynomials using structured, non-symbolic representations.

Unlike symbolic engines, PolyAny operates directly on the algebraic structure of polynomials (coefficients and exponents), enabling integration with numerical libraries and efficient structural transformations.

---

## 🔧 Features (planned)

- Polynomial creation from multiple formats (list, tuples, NumPy arrays, quadratic forms, ...)
- Support for multivariate expressions
- Algebraic operations: addition, multiplication, truncation, homogenization, ...
- Polynomial exporting into LaTeX code

## 📦 Installation

> ⚠️ Not yet available in PyPI.

This project uses `uv` to manage dependencies and environments.

> 🚀 To install uv, follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

For local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rolmip/polyany.git
cd polyany
uv sync
```
